# fashionCORE_v3

Welcome to fashionCORE_v3 - an advanced AI-based virtual clothing try-on application.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of fashionCORE_v3 is designed to ensure seamless integration and high-quality performance. It consists of several key components:

### 1. **Frontend**

- **Technologies Used**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Features**:
  - User-friendly interface for uploading images and selecting clothing items.
  - Integration with Amazon and Flipkart APIs to fetch the latest fashion trends.
  - Real-time display of virtual try-on results.

### 2. **Backend**

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Flask
- **Features**:
  - API endpoints for handling image uploads, processing requests, and fetching data.
  - Interaction with the AI model to generate try-on results.
  - Authentication system to ensure secure user access.

### 3. **AI Model**

- **Models Used**: IDM, various other models for different aspects (pose estimation, background handling, etc.)
- **Capabilities**:
  - Handles 3D poses and different angles.
  - Processes complex backgrounds and multiple people in an image.
  - Produces high-quality, realistic outputs.
- **Workflows**:
  - **Image Upload**: User uploads an image of themselves.
  - **Clothing Selection**: User selects reference clothing images.
  - **Image Processing**: AI model processes the input image and overlays the selected clothing.
  - **Result Generation**: High-quality output image is generated and displayed to the user.

### 4. **Database**

- **Technologies Used**: PostgreSQL
- **Features**:
  - Stores user information and authentication data.
  - Maintains a catalog of clothing items fetched from APIs.
  - Keeps logs of user activities and generated results for analytics.

### 5. **Integration Services**

- **Amazon and Flipkart APIs**:
  - Fetches the latest clothing items and accessories.
  - Displays fetched items in the frontend for user selection.
- **Mailpit**:
  - Handles email notifications and communication.
  - Ensures users are notified of important updates and results.

### 6. **Deployment**

- **Technologies Used**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Features**:
  - Containerized deployment for easy scalability and management.
  - Kubernetes orchestration for handling multiple instances and load balancing.

## Detailed Workflow

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users sign up or log in to the application.
   - Secure authentication ensures user data is protected.

2. **Image and Clothing Selection**:
   - Users upload their image.
   - Users select clothing items either from the integrated APIs or upload reference images.

3. **AI Processing**:
   - The backend sends the images to the AI model.
   - The AI model processes the images, handling poses, backgrounds, and multiple subjects.

4. **Result Generation and Display**:
   - Processed images are sent back to the frontend.
   - Users view and download the high-quality try-on results.

5. **Data Storage and Analytics**:
   - User data, images, and activity logs are stored in the database.
   - Analytics are performed to improve the model and user experience.
